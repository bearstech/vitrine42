Vitrine 42
==========

Arduino projects for the Matrix42 demo at "La grotte".

This projects use [Arduino board ethernet](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet), and [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) as control protocol.

Z\_OSC library is used for the Arduino side. This library is easy to used but only compile on OSX plateform. It's very annoying.

Debug and testing is done with [osc-tools](https://github.com/bearstech/osc-tools).
